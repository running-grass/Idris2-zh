msgid "In this section, we will provide a proof of ``plus_commutes`` directly, by writing a pattern matching definition. We will use interactive editing features extensively, since it is significantly easier to produce a proof when the machine can give the types of intermediate values and construct components of the proof itself. The commands we will use are summarised below. Where we refer to commands directly, we will use the Vim version, but these commands have a direct mapping to Emacs commands."
