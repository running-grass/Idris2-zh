msgid "Idris 2 is designed to support multiple code generators. The default target is Chez Scheme, with Racket and Gambit code generators also supported. However, the intention is, as with Idris 1, to support multiple targets on multiple platforms, including e.g. JavaScript, JVM, .NET, and others yet to be invented. This makes the design of a foreign function interface (FFI), which calls functions in other languages, a little challenging, since ideally it will support all possible targets!"

msgid "To this end, the Idris 2 FFI aims to be flexible and adaptable, while still supporting most common requirements without too much need for \"glue\" code in the foreign language."
