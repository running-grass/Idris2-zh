msgid "Idris 2 (the language) is designed to be independent of any specific code generator. Still, since the point of writing a program is to be able to run it, it's important to know how to do so! By default, Idris compiles to executables via `Chez Scheme <https://www.scheme.com/>`_."

msgid "...where ``execname`` is the name of the executable file to generate, and ``expr`` is the Idris expression which will be executed. ``expr`` must have type ``IO ()``.

msgid "By default, Idris 2 is a whole program compiler - that is, it finds all the necessary function definitions and compiles them only when you build an executable. This gives plenty of optimisation opportunities, but can also be slow for rebuilding. However, if the backend supports it, you can build modules and executables *incrementally*:"

msgid "If the backend supports it, you can generate profiling data by setting the ``profile`` flag, either by starting Idris with ``--profile``, or running ``:set profile`` at the REPL. The profile data generated will depend on the back end you are using. Currently, the Chez and Racket back ends support generating profile data."

msgid "There are five code generators provided in Idris 2, and there is a system for plugging in new code generators for a variety of targets. The default is to compile via Chez Scheme, with an alternative via Racket or Gambit. You can set the code generator at the REPL with the `:set codegen` command, or via the `IDRIS2_CG` environment variable."
