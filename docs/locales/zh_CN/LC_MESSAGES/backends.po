"First of all, we should know that Idris2 is not an optimizing compiler. "
"Currently its focus is only to compile dependently typed functional code "
"in a timely manner. Its main purpose is to check if the given program is "
"correct in a dependently typed setting and generate code in form of a "
"lambda-calculus like IR where higher-order functions are present. Idris "
"has 3 intermediate representations for code generation. At every level we"
" get a simpler representation, closer to machine code, but it should be "
"stressed that all the aggressive code optimizations should happen in the "
"custom back-ends. The quality and readability of the generated back-end "
"code is on the shoulders of the implementor of the back-end. Idris erases"
" type information, in the IRs as it compiles to scheme by default, and "
"there is no need to keep the type information around. With this in mind "
